```assembly
mov ax, 0x1234
add ax, bx
; ... some other instructions ...
mov [data_segment], ax
```

The error occurs when the value of `bx` is unexpectedly large.  If `bx` contains a value that, when added to `ax`, results in an overflow, the resulting value in `ax` will be incorrect. This is because the addition instruction only uses the lower 16 bits of `bx` for calculation. If the addition of the lower 16 bits of `bx` to `ax` results in a value greater than 0xFFFF, it will cause an overflow and wrap around to a lower value.
